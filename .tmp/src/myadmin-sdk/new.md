<h3 class="text-primary font-weight-bold">Updates</h3>

#### GetDeviceContractsByPage & GetDeviceContracts

- Along with the new `Auto-Activated` and `Billing Start Date` columns in Device Admin, we have added two new parameters to the **GetDeviceContractsByPage** and **GetDeviceContracts** methods:
    - `isAutoActivated` — Returns a result that indicates whether the device was auto-activated by Geotab.
        - true — The device was auto-activated by Geotab.
        - false — The device has yet to be activated or was activated from being installed in an asset.
    - `billingStartDate` — Returns the date when the device was activated.
<br/>  

#### CalculateVinOemEligibilitiesAsync and GetOemSupportEligibilityForMakeAsync

- Together with the Vehicle / VIN Lookup page improvements, we’ve added the following APIs to allow you to confirm whether a vehicle or VIN is eligible for OEM connectivity services:
    - **CalculateVinOemEligibilitiesAsync** — Returns a result that indicates whether a VIN in a specific region is eligible for OEM connectivity services.
    - **GetOemSupportEligibilityForMakeAsync** — Returns a result that indicates whether a vehicle make and model in a specific region is eligible for OEM connectivity services.
<br/>   

#### GetOnlineOrderStatus

- We have added a new `shippingCost` field as a return object to the **GetOnlineOrderStatus** method. This field will return the shipping cost at the time the order was placed.  
<br/>

<h3 class="text-primary font-weight-bold">Updates</h3>

#### MyAdminAPIUser

- We have deprecated the **MyAdminApiUser** role. This role was initially used to make MyAdmin API calls, but we confirmed that API calls are open to anyone with a MyAdmin account. As a result, we have deprecated the role to reduce confusion and simplify access to our API. 
<br/>  

#### CalculateVinOemEligibilitiesAsync and GetOemSupportEligibilityForMakeAsync

- Together with the Vehicle / VIN Lookup page improvements, we’ve added the following APIs to allow you to confirm whether a vehicle or VIN is eligible for OEM connectivity services:

<br/>   

#### DatabaseExists

- To save time when creating new databases, we’ve added a new **DatabaseExists** method that returns a true or false value to allow you to confirm whether a database name already exists:
    - **true** — The database name already exists
    - **false** — The database name does not exist  
<br/>

#### GetOnlineOrderStatus

- In a future release, we will be adding a new `shippingCost` field as a return object to the **GetOnlineOrderStatus** method. This field will return the shipping cost at the time the order was placed.

    - purchaseOrderNo
    - orderNo
    - orderDateFrom
    - orderDateTo
- There will also be a limit of 5000 orders that can be retrieved in a single request.

<h3 class="text-primary font-weight-bold">Updates</h3>

#### ProvisionDevicesBulk

- Currently, **ProvisionDevice** and **ProvisionDeviceToAccount** methods are available to provision a single third-party custom telematics or OEM device (via the serial number).
- To help you manage large quantities of devices, we’ve added a new **ProvisionDevicesBulk** method to provision multiple third-party custom telematics devices or OEM in bulk with an optional quantity field.
<br/>

<h3 class="text-danger font-weight-bold">Coming Soon</h3>

#### GetDeviceContractsByPage and GetDeviceContracts

- In a future release, we will be adding two new columns to Device Admin: `Auto-Activated` and `Billing Start Date` to improve visibility of auto-activation events, as well as the actual start of billing for a device. 
- The `Auto-Activated` column will help you identify whether a device has been automatically activated by Geotab, and display the following values:
    - **Yes** — The device was automatically activated by Geotab.
    - **No** — The device was activated by installation.
    - **Not Available** — The device has been shipped, but has not been installed, or auto-activated.\
    **NOTE**: For devices shipped prior to the release of this feature, **Not Available** will be displayed.
- The `Billing Start Date` column will help you determine when billing started for a device. This column will display one of the following values:
    - **Date** — Displays the date that the device was auto-activated, installed, or transferred from another Partner.\
    **NOTE**: Plan changes for devices will not impact this date.
    - **Not Available** — Indicates that a device has been shipped, but has not been installed, or auto-activated.\
    **NOTE**: For devices shipped prior to the release of this feature, **Not Available** will be displayed.
- Therefore, we will also be making data points of `Auto-Activated` and `Billing Start Date` available through the **GetDeviceContractsByPage** and **GetDeviceContracts** APIs in a future release. We will provide more details closer to the release date.   

#### GetOnlineOrderStatus

- In an upcoming release, we will be adding the following parameters to the **GetOnlineOrderStatus** API:
- `promoCode` — Returns the promo code used when the order was placed, if applicable.
- `rateCode` — Returns the promo code used for a monthly Rate Plan subscription when the order was placed, if applicable.

- This ID can be leveraged alongside **GetUserContacts** to return all the contact details of the user contact (currently **DeviceContractTransactions** only returns `UserContactName`)

#### ForceChangePasswordForUsersAsync

- The **ForceChangePasswordForUsersAsync** method now allows you to toggle on 'Force Password Change' for user accounts so that you can decide how often users are resetting their passwords

#### PartnerDeviceContractsAsync

- A new API, **GetPartnerDeviceContractsAsync**, has been added to allow Marketplace Partners and Integration Partners to retrieve a list of active devices they’ve produced, as well as the database each device is connected to.
- With this API, these Partners can set up, service, and support their products, as well as ensure their products are properly functioning. 
- The `ThirdPartyPartner-Admin` role is required to access the **GetPartnerDeviceContractsAsync** API.
