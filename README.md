# MyGeotab SDK JavaScript Examples

The following examples show common usages of the SDK using JavaScript. We recommend that you study the examples to learn everything necessary to build your own custom applications.

## How to run the examples?

You can clone this repo, go into the `src/software/js-samples` folder, and open the `HTML` file of the example you would like to view in your preferred browser.

> The examples are embedded in a subfolder in this repo as this repo used to contain code that is now deprecated. Given that these examples are widely used and could be bookmarked by the public, we have kept the same folder structure as before to prevent any inconvenience.
