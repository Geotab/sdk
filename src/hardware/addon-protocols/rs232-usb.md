title: Add-On Protocol - RS232 & USB
---

External devices can communicate with the Geotab GO device through the Third-Party RS232 and USB protocol below. The hardware interface will be one of the following:

 - [IOX-RS232 F/M](https://www.geotab.com/documentation/iox-rs232/ "IOX-RS232 Support Documentation")
 - [IOX-USB](https://www.geotab.com/documentation/iox-usb/ "IOX-USB Support Documentation")

## Special Requirements
#### Enabling IOX-USB Data Transfer

To enable third-party data communication on the IOX-USB, apply the following custom parameter to the GO device through MyGeotab.

```xml
<GoParameters><Parameter Description="Enable USB Data" Offset="164" Bytes="02"/></GoParameters>
```

\* *Note* \- The GO device will automatically upgrade to the ProPlus rate plan once third-party data transfer begins.
#### IOX-USB Communication Consideration
 
The IOX-USB operates as a USB 2.0 full-speed host. The maximum data transfer rate is 12 Mbit/s. The IOX-USB can use two methods to enumerate a USB device:

1. The [Android Open Accessory protocol (*AOA*)](https://source.android.com/devices/accessories/protocol.html). This [sample project](https://github.com/Geotab/android-external-device-example "Android Open Accessory Sample") can be used as a framework.
2. USB-CDC (Communications Device Class)

## Integration Process

The following process should be followed when integrating a third-party device with the GO device using our Third-Party Data Protocol.

#### Contact Solutions Engineering

Contact the [Geotab Solutions Engineering team](mailto:soleng@geotab.com) with a detailed integration proposal, this should include:

 - A name for the integration
 - The interfacing hardware
 - Data types that will be sent to MyGeotab
 - The required Status Data
 - Direction of data transfer
 - Expected timelines for integrating
 
The Solutions Engineering team will respond with follow up questions to define the integration, and assign an External device ID, and any Status Data IDs that would be required. 

An additional resource is the [Hardware Integration Toolkit](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nkmDYw2tscZxKaezFm5sR3jLItI3IRJTS6JIhgg0rFU/edit#slide=id.g625282e7fc_0_0) with integration walkthrough.

#### Using Status Data IDs

There is an extensively defined Status Data ID list which can be found at MyGeotab >  **Engine & Maintenance** > **Engine & Device…** > **Diagnostics**. For each piece of information, conversion parameters are also required. Conversions must be in the form as per the table below:

| Status Data ID | Description | Multiplier | Offset | Unit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5 (assigned by Geotab) | Odometer | 0.1 | 0 | km |
| 53 (assigned by Geotab) | Outside Temperature | 1 | −40 | degrees C |

A multiplier and offset must be supplied by the third-party vendor when requesting Status Data IDs so that MyGeotab can convert the data.



The GO device will relay the raw data sent by the external device to MyGeotab. MyGeotab will then take the raw value received from the GO device and adjust by the multiplier and the offset, as per the formula:

<b><center><i>
Final Value = (Initial Value × Multiplier) + Offset
</i></center></b>

The unit refers to the unit of measurement that you wish to see in MyGeotab after all the conversions are complete. Geotab uses metric units and all predefined status IDs currently used by Geotab are in metric units.

**Example:**

- If you are reporting a temperature range from -40 °C to 215 °C, the third-party device would send values from 0 to 255 (can&#39;t send negative values). The offset would be set to -40 so that MyGeotab would know to subtract 40 from the value obtained from the GO device. So a reported value of 0 by the third-party device would show up as -40 °C in MyGeotab.

- The third-party device is sending a distance in 0.1 km increments, such that a value of 1223 represents a distance of 122.3 km. A multiplier of 0.1 should be applied so that the value is properly converted to kilometers on MyGeotab.

<!-- The below note will be added once the Status ID link is available -->

<!-- *Note* : There are some Status Data IDs that are restricted to coming from the Go Device, an extensive list of the Add-On device range can be found *linked here* -->

#### Handshake

An initial Handshake **is required** in order for the GO device to accept third-party data. Ignition must be on for the handshake process.

1. After powering up, the GO device will enter an external device detection cycle. The external device will be powered for 72 seconds. In this interval, the GO device will listen for a [Handshake Sync](#handshake-sync-auto-baud-detect-for-rs232) from the external device. The Handshake Sync is used to indicate that an external device is present. For implementations using the IOX-RS232, the Handshake Sync is also used to detect baud rate.
  - The external device must send the Handshake Sync message once per second.
  - If a Handshake Sync message is not detected from the external device after 72 seconds, the external device is powered down for 5 seconds, then powered up again to restart the detection cycle.
2. The GO device will reply to a Handshake Sync with a [Handshake Request](#msg-type-0x01-handshake-request).
3. The external device must reply with a [Handshake Confirmation](#msg-type-0x81-handshake-confirmation) message within 2 seconds. If the external device would like an acknowledgment from the GO device that it received the Handshake Confirmation message, the corresponding flag in the Handshake Confirmation message may be set.
4. After sending the Handshake Confirmation message, the external device can begin to send third-party data as required. For every [Third-Party Data Message](#msg-type-0x80-third-party-data-as-status-data) sent, the GO device will reply with a [Data Acknowledge message](#msg-type-0x02-third-party-data-acknowledge).
  - If the external device receives no response to a Third-Party Data message, it must restart the handshake process — returning to step 1 above.
5. The GO device may send a Handshake Request message at any time after the initial handshake. The external device must respond with a Handshake Confirmation message. If the external device does not respond, it must restart the handshake process — returning to step 1 above.

#### Checksum

Each message will contain a 2-byte Fletcher's Checksum calculated across all the bytes of the message except the checksum itself. The checksum values are bytes, and as such overflow from 255 (0xFF) to 0 (0x00). The bytes used for the checksum calculation are all the bytes up to the checksum byte, including STX, LEN, TYPE, but not including ETX.

Checksum calculation pseudo code:

```js
byte ChkA = 0;
byte ChkB = 0;
// n is the number of bytes in the message
// up to, but not including, the checksum
for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
ChkA = ChkA + MsgBuffer[i];
ChkB = ChkB + ChkA;
}
// ChkA precedes ChkB in the message
```

#### Data Endianness

All values must be sent using Little Endian Byte Order, meaning the least significant byte first.

#### Msg Type 0x82: Free Format Third-Party Data

Issued by the external device whenever it wants Third-Party Data to be saved on the GO device in a free format (1 to 27 bytes) that will be saved into MyGeotab as Custom Data.

|   | Bytes | Position |
| --- | --- | --- |
| STX (0x02) | 1 | 0 |

| Message Type = 0x84 | 1 | 1 |
| Message Body Length = 0 | 1 | 2 |
| Checksum | 2 | 3 |
| ETX (0x03) | 1 | 5 |

For the purpose of acknowledging the GO Device Data message when connected as an Enhanced HOS Device:

- The GO device will keep streaming the GO Device Data messages even if no ACK is received for up to 30 seconds.
- If no ACK is received in that time frame the GO Device will send an External Device Disconnected record to the server and will wait for a new Handshake Sync request from the External Device.
- If the ACK message is received within the 30 seconds the counter will be re-initialized.

#### Msg Type 0x85: Request Device Data Message

This is a request-response message. It can be issued by the External Device whenever it wishes to receive the Device Data Info Message (Msg Type 0x21).

|   | Bytes | Position |
| --- | --- | --- |

#### Msg Type 0x86: Binary Data Packet

Sent by the external device when sending binary data directly to the server. The contents of the message will be ignored by the GO device and simply sent on to the server for processing. The GO device will respond with the Binary Data Response message indicating whether the data was successfully sent via the modem.

|   | Bytes | Position |
| --- | --- | --- |
| STX (0x02) | 1 | 0 |
| Message Type = 0x86 | 1 | 1 |

| ETX (0x03) | 1 | 5+x |
| Reply: Binary Data Response ([Msg Type 0x22](#msg-type-0x22-binary-data-response)) |   |   |

The payload of the binary data would need to adhere to a protocol understood by the server. The MIME data transfer protocol is under review and will be linked to from here when ready. The proposed implementation includes:

- Length of MIME type (1 byte)
- MIME type in ASCII
- Length of body (4 bytes)
- Body (raw bytes of MIME-type specified)

The MIME data message would need to be broken into 250 byte (or less) chunks and sent using the binary data packet (Msg Type 0x86). The server would stitch together the binary bytes and make then available via the MyGeotab SDK once the full amount of bytes was received. See Appendix C.

#### Msg Type 0x87: Third-Party Data as Priority Status Data

Priority Status Data will be treated the same as the 0x80 Status Data message, but will also be logged using an Iridium modem connection if available.

|   | Bytes | Position |
| --- | --- | --- |
| STX (0x02) | 1 | 0 |
| Message Type = 0x87 | 1 | 1 |
| Message Body Length = 6 | 1 | 2 |
| Data ID (assigned by Geotab) | 2 | 3 |
| Data | 4 | 5 |
| Checksum | 2 | 9 |
| ETX (0x03) | 1 | 11 |
| Reply: Third-Party Data Ack ([Msg Type 0x02](#msg-type-0x02-third-party-data-acknowledge)) |

#### Msg Type 0x89: Ping

After handshaking, this message can be issued periodically by the External Device to check that the GO device is active and ready. The GO device will normally reply with the Third-Party Data Ack (Msg Type 0x02). If this reply is not received, the External Device should reset and begin sending the Handshake Sync (0x55).

|   | Bytes | Position |
| --- | --- | --- |
| STX (0x02) | 1 | 0 |
| Message Type = 0x89 | 1 | 1 |
| Message Body Length = 0 | 1 | 2 |
| Checksum | 2 | 3 |
| ETX (0x03) | 1 | 5 |
| Reply: Third-Party Data Ack ([Msg Type 0x02](#msg-type-0x02-third-party-data-acknowledge)) |

#### Appendix B: Sample Message Flow for IOX-USB & IOX-RS232

 ![]({{site.baseurl}}/hardware/addon-protocols/rs232-usb_0.png)

#### Appendix C: Using Binary Data Messages to Transfer MIME Data

MIME-type data can be transferred from an external device to the server via the GO device. The Message Flow is similar to that outlined in [Appendix B](#appendix-b-sample-message-flow-for-iox-usb--iox-rs232), with the following variations:
1. Third-Party Data Message is instantiated as Binary Data Packet Containing MIME Type Data, whose format is [such](#binary-data-packets-containing-mime-type-data)
2. Data Acknowledge Message is instantiated as Binary Data Response (0x22)
3. After the last Binary Data Response, add a Binary Data Packet Containing MIME Type Acknowledge, whose format is [such](#binary-data-packet-containing-mime-type-acknowledge). Once the complete payload of the MIME message is successfully received by MyGeotab, a MIME ACK will be sent back to the GO device.

MIME-type data will be saved as a MIME-type blob on the server. The blob can be accessed through the software SDK as a [TextMessage](https://geotab.github.io/sdk/software/api/reference/#T:Geotab.Checkmate.ObjectModel.TextMessage). The SDK can also be used to send MIME-type data from the server to an external device connected to a GO device.

#### The MIME Type Protocol:

|   | Bytes | Position |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MIME type length = x | 1 | 0 |
| MIME type in ASCII | x | 1 |
| Payload Length = y | 4 | 1 + x |
| Binary Payload | y | 5 + x |

The MIME protocol will be an inner protocol within the binary data packet messages. The MIME data will be broken into 250 byte chunks and sent within binary data packet messages. The first byte within the message will be a sequence counter; all remaining bytes will contain the MIME data.

#### Binary Data Packets Containing MIME Type Data

This is an example of binary data packets for image data transferred using the MIME type "image/jpeg". The image size is 83000 bytes.
