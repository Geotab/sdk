title: Add-On Protocol - RS232 & USB
---

External devices can communicate with a Geotab GO device through the Third-Party RS232 and USB protocols linked below. Two-way communication is supported, allowing a MyGeotab API call to produce messages from the IOX device to reach the external device. The hardware interface is one of the following:

 - [IOX-RS232 F/M](https://www.geotab.com/documentation/iox-rs232/ "IOX-RS232 Support Documentation")
 - [IOX-USB](https://www.geotab.com/documentation/iox-usb/ "IOX-USB Support Documentation")

## Special Requirements
### Enabling IOX-USB Data Transfer

To enable third-party data communication on the IOX-USB, apply the following custom parameter to the GO device through MyGeotab:

```xml
<GoParameters><Parameter Description="Enable USB Data" Offset="164" Bytes="02"/></GoParameters>
```

\* *Note* \- The GO device will automatically upgrade to the ProPlus rate plan once third-party data transfer begins.

### IOX-USB Communication Consideration
 
The IOX-USB operates as a USB 2.0 full-speed host. The maximum data transfer rate is 12 Mbit/s. The IOX-USB can use two methods to enumerate a USB device:

1. The [Android Open Accessory protocol (*AOA*)](https://source.android.com/devices/accessories/protocol.html). This [sample project](https://github.com/Geotab/android-external-device-example "Android Open Accessory Sample") can be used as a framework.
2. USB-CDC (Communications Device Class)

### Powering a device using the IOX-RS232 and IOX-USB
Both the IOX-USB and the IOX-RS232 can provide power to an Add-On Device. 

- The IOX-USB can provide 1.5A at 5V as a power output. 
- The IOX-RS232 supports 900mA at 12/24V to the external red (power) and black (ground) wires. However, it is not required to power the Add-On device using the IOX-RS232.

### Grounding a device
Even if the Hardware Add-On has a separate connection to vehicle power and ground, it is still recommended to connect the Add-On ground to the ground wire of the IOX-RS232, as this improves signal integrity.

### Serial Port Settings For Add-Ons

Geotab recommends that RS232/USB serial ports are programmed in accordance with the following specifications:

- Baud Rate: 9600 or 115200. Note: the device is equipped with autobaud detection, so other standard rates are acceptable.
- Parity: None
- Stop Bits: 1
- Flow Control: None

## Integration Process

The following process should be followed when integrating a third-party device with the GO device using our Third-Party Data Protocol:

### Contact Solutions Engineering

Contact the [Geotab Solutions Engineering team](mailto:soleng@geotab.com) with a detailed integration proposal, which should include:

 - A name for the integration
 - The interfacing hardware
 - Data types that will be sent to MyGeotab
 - The required Status Data
 - Direction of data transfer
 - Expected timelines for integrating
 
The Solutions Engineering team will respond with followup questions to define the integration, and assign an External device ID and any Status Data IDs that would be required. 

An additional resource is the [Hardware Integration Toolkit](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nkmDYw2tscZxKaezFm5sR3jLItI3IRJTS6JIhgg0rFU/edit#slide=id.g625282e7fc_0_0) with integration walkthrough.

### Using Status Data IDs

There is an extensively defined Status Data ID list which can be found at [MyGeotab Diagnostics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sy7IOhWmFoo40_I-ruOJO8bVTMLXqHa11d0oJtaoIcE/edit#gid=1133172080). Specifics regarding Status Data ID implementations can be found on the README sheet. 

### Handshake

An initial Handshake **is required** in order for the GO device to accept third-party data. Vehicle ignition must be on during the handshake process.

1. After powering up, the GO device will enter an external device detection cycle. The external device will be powered for 72 seconds. In this interval, the GO device will listen for a [Handshake Sync](#handshake-sync-auto-baud-detect-for-rs232) from the external device. The Handshake Sync is used to indicate that an external device is present. For implementations using the IOX-RS232, the Handshake Sync is also used to detect baud rate.
  - The external device must send the Handshake Sync message once per second.
  - If a Handshake Sync message is not detected from the external device after 72 seconds, the external device is powered down for 5 seconds, then powered up again to restart the detection cycle.
2. The GO device will reply to a Handshake Sync with a [Handshake Request](#msg-type-0x01-handshake-request).
3. The external device must reply with a [Handshake Confirmation](#msg-type-0x81-handshake-confirmation) message within 2 seconds. If the external device would like an acknowledgment from the GO device that it received the Handshake Confirmation message, the corresponding flag in the Handshake Confirmation message may be set.
4. After sending the Handshake Confirmation message, the external device can begin to send third-party data as required. For every [Third-Party Data Message](#msg-type-0x80-third-party-data-as-status-data) sent, the GO device will reply with a [Data Acknowledge message](#msg-type-0x02-third-party-data-acknowledge).
  - If the external device receives no response to a Third-Party Data message, it must restart the handshake process — returning to step 1 above.
5. The GO device may send a Handshake Request message at any time after the initial handshake. The external device must respond with a Handshake Confirmation message. If the external device does not respond, it must restart the handshake process — returning to step 1 above.

### Checksum

Each message contains a 2-byte Fletcher's Checksum calculated across all the bytes of the message except the checksum itself. The checksum values are bytes, and as such overflow from 255 (0xFF) to 0 (0x00). The bytes used for the checksum calculation are all the bytes up to the checksum byte, including STX, LEN, TYPE, but not including ETX.

Checksum calculation pseudocode:

```js
byte ChkA = 0;
byte ChkB = 0;
// n is the number of bytes in the message
// up to, but not including, the checksum
for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
ChkA = ChkA + MsgBuffer[i];
ChkB = ChkB + ChkA;
}
// ChkA precedes ChkB in the message
```

### Data Endianness

All values must be sent using Little-Endian Byte Order, meaning the least significant byte is first.

## Messages from the GO device

### Appendix C: Using Binary Data Messages to Transfer MIME Data

MIME-type data can be transferred from an external device to the server via the GO device. The protocol is described in [MIME passthrough messages]({{site.baseurl}}/hardware/developing-an-iox/mime-protocol/).

 The Message Flow is similar to that outlined in [Appendix B](#appendix-b-sample-message-flow-for-iox-usb--iox-rs232), with the following variations:
1. Third-Party Data Message is instantiated as Binary Data Packet Containing MIME Type Data, whose format is [such](#binary-data-packets-containing-mime-type-data)
2. Data Acknowledge Message is instantiated as Binary Data Response (0x22)
3. After the last Binary Data Response, add a Binary Data Packet Containing MIME Type Acknowledge, whose format is [such](#binary-data-packet-containing-mime-type-acknowledge). Once the complete payload of the MIME message is successfully received by MyGeotab, a MIME ACK will be sent back from MyGeotab.

Readers are encouraged to also read the [Geotab MIME Data Exchange Example IOX-RS232](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a8XCgpmEEbx6KxnFxhu40XULWr2uZeAG_5aKkm-Mjnw/edit?usp=sharing) to better understand of the protocol.

#### Binary Data Packets Containing MIME Type Data

This is an example of binary data packets for image data transferred using the MIME type “image/jpeg”. The image size is 83000 bytes. The packet size is 250.

**First packet:**

|   | Bytes | Position |
| --- | --- | --- |
| STX (0x02) | 1 | 0 |
| Message Type = 0x86 | 1 | 1 |
| Message Body Length = 250 | 1 | 2 |
| **Sequence number = 0** | **1** | **3** |
| **MIME type length = 10** | **1** | **4** |
| **MIME type ("image/jpeg")** | **10** | **5** |
| **Payload Length = 83000** | **4** | **15** |
| **Binary Payload (the first 234 bytes)** | **234** | **19** |
| Checksum | 2 | 253 |
| ETX (0x03) | 1 | 255 |

**Second packet:**

|   | Bytes | Position |
| --- | --- | --- |
| STX (0x02) | 1 | 0 |
| Message Type = 0x86 | 1 | 1 |
| Message Body Length = 250 | 1 | 2 |
| **Sequence number = 1**\* | **1** | **3** |
| **Binary Payload (the next 249 bytes)** | **249** | **4** |
| Checksum | 2 | 253 |
| ETX (0x03) | 1 | 255 |

#### Binary Data Packet Containing MIME Type Acknowledge

|   | Bytes | Position |
| --- | --- | --- |
| STX (0x02) | 1 | 0 |
| Message Type = 0x23 | 1 | 1 |
| Message Body Length = 9+x | 1 | 2 |
| Sequence Number = 0 | 1 | 3 |
| MIME type length = 3 | 1 | 4 |
| MIME type in ASCII = 'ACK' | 3 | 5 |
| Payload Length = x | 4 | 8 |
| Total Number of Payload Bytes Received | x | 12 |
| Checksum | 2 | 12+x |
| ETX (0x03) | 1 | 14+x |
