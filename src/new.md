### Notice

An issue was discovered which could cause integrations using the Geotab.Checkmate.Objectmodel nuget package v5.7.1801 and lower to encounter a serailizaion failure when a new DiagnosticType is introduced. The issue has been addressed in nuget package v[5.7.1802](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Geotab.Checkmate.ObjectModel/). To ensure compatibility, it is strongly recommended that all integrations referencing the nuget package v5.7.1801 and lower update to version v5.7.1802 as soon as possible. (this issue is only relevant to .Net nuget package users)

## 5.7.1801

* KnownId - Removed: `UnitOfMeasureLitersPer100KilometersId`. Diagnostics associated with this unit of measure now use `UnitOfMeasureKilometersPerLiterId`. This will not affect any previously recorded data.

* KnownId - Added: `DiagnosticGpsLogReasonId`, `DiagnosticEngineRoadSpeedId`

* ConditionType - Added: `DVIRDefect` - Currently works with Devices not Trailers

* SecurityIdentifier - Added: `DriverIdentificationClearance`, `AccelerometerDataClearance`, `ServicePlansClearance`, `AuxiliaryClearance`, `EngineStatusDataClearance`, `ResellerControlClearance`, `GoTalkClearance`, `StatusGroupsClearance`, `ProductGuideClearance`, `FeaturePreviewClearance`, `NewsNotificationsClearance`, `ManageAddinsClearance`, `DeviceCurrentStatusClearance`

### Notice

In early 2018 the following legacy properties will be removed:

**Authenticate**: `userLogin` parameter. This was kept around for compatibility with legacy (5.6.* and lower) integrations. It has not been publicly exposed or documented since version 5.6 of MyGeotab. It is planned to be removed as a valid parameter in version 5.7.1803. The `userName` parameter is the standard supported property that should be used.

**LoginResult**: `securityToken` property. LoginResult is the object returned by the Authenticate method. It's property `securityToken` was kept around for compatibility with legacy (5.6.* and lower) integrations. It has not been publicly exposed or documented since version 5.6 of MyGeotab. It is planned to be removed as a valid parameter in version 5.7.1803. The property `credentials` is the standard supported property that shares the same value.

## 5.7.1712

* API.cs (.Net only) - Fix: When password and session id are supplied to constructor, session id will be used until no longer valid. Previously, session id would only be used if password was not supplied.

* FuelTaxDetail - Added properties: ”IsEnterOdometerInterpolated”, “IsExitOdometerInterpolated”, “HourlyIsOdometerInterpolated”

* User - Removed property: “MenuCollapsedNotified”

## 5.7.1711

* GetAddresses - Added: "hosAddresses" parameter to optionally search for ELD compliant address

* UnitOfMeaure - Added: Kilowatt hours ("UnitOfMeasureKiloWattHoursId")

* SecurityIdentifier - Added "ViewBinaryData", "ManageAddInData", "ViewAddInData"

* HosRuleSet - Added "CarrierExemption"

* .Net SDK samples updated to target netcoreapp2.0

* .Net nuget package now supports framework: netstandard2.0 (removed support for net46)

## 5.7.1709

* API.cs (.Net only) - Added cancellation token parameter to AuthenticateAsync and CallAsync methods.

* DutyStatusLog - Added "Malfunction" property - The DutyStatusMalfunctionType of the DutyStatusLog record. As a flag it can be both a diagnostic and malfunction state which is used to mark status based records (e.g. "D", "SB") as having a diagnostic or malfunction present at time of recording.

* DutyStatusLog - Added "Sequence" property - The sequence number, which is used to generate the sequence ID.

* DutyStatusLogType - Added "EnginePowerup", "EngineShutdown", "EnginePowerupPC", "EngineShutdownPC", "PowerCompliance", "EngineSyncCompliance", "TimingCompliance", "PositioningCompliance", "DataRecordingCompliance", "DataTransferCompliance", "OtherCompliance", "MissingElementCompliance", "UnidentifiedDrivingCompliance", "INT_PC", "INT_D".

* Controller - Added short integer "CodeId" property, which will replace the "Code" property. New "AnyController" for J1708 engine diagnostics to allow replacing those engine diagnostics identical except for the controller with one diagnostic. J1708 engine diagnostics for 58 separate SIDs were updated.

* CustomDevice - Added "VehicleIdentificationNumber" property.

* FuelTaxDetail - Added "Driver" property.

* DriverChangeSearch - Added "IncludeOverlappedChanges" property - A value indicating whether to include the last driver change before the from date or the most recent driver change (if the from date is not provided).

* InvalidUserException - Message changed from to "Incorrect MyGeotab login credentials..." to "Incorrect login credentials...".

### New Objects

* DutyStatusMalfunctionType - Added - Malfunction or Diagnostic type of the DutyStatusLog.

* DutyStatusState - Added - The record status of DutyStatusLog.

## 5.7.1707

* Web Request Notifications: fix {zoneId} and {zoneComment} tokens would not get populated unless {zone} or {address} were also included.

* Documentation: API Reference updated to include default value and max length of object properties in their descriptions. Default values are automatically used when adding an entity and those properties have no value assigned (are null). For example, adding a Group with color = null, will add group with default color "Blue". If a property has no default value, it is required when calling "Add".

* Set operations now retain the value of missing (null) properties. A positive effect of this change is that is remedies a long existing issue that could occur when a server is a newer version (ex 5.7.1704) than client nuget package (ex 5.7.1701) which is making requests to it. The issue could arise when a new Enum value was added and exists only in the server's code base, not client client nuget package. When the unknown Enum was received by the client, it could not be deserialiezed into an Enum value and would throw an exception. Starting in nuget package version 5.7.1707.x, the unknown Enum value will be deserialiezed to null. This means the object can round trip" on "Set" because the server will now (starting at version 5.7.1707) fill in the null value with the existing saved value of the property.

* Added: JsonRpcError, JsonRpcErrorData - to better align JSON-RPC errors with the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification. Non-standard (now legacy) error properties have been deprecated. This should not affect nuget package users as the API.cs object serialized the JSON-RPC error results as Exceptions which are thrown. This may affect users consuming the raw JSON-RPC result of requests. It's recommended to update usages to the official, standardized, properties as outlined in the API Reference. Of note: the new objects exposes "requestIndex" property which is the index at which a "multicall" failed.

* Added: User/Driver objects now have property "IsDriver" to clearly indicate when a user is a driver. This also makes it easier to save a user who is no longer a driver, set the property to false and save.

* Added: FuelTaxDetail - A new entity which provides API access to calculated fuel tax data. In the past this data was only available via the IFTA Report in MyGeotab where it was calculated on the fly. Fuel tax details are now processed using live data and stored in the database and they can be access using the API via Get and GetFeed methods. Full documentation coming soon.

## 5.7.1706

* DatabaseId has been removed from .net package as per the [December 2016 post](https://helpdesk.geotab.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/255601466--NET-SDK-ID-Object-Changes)

***requires update of .net nuget package to ensure compatibility***

* SecurityRole.cs Added: ReassignData
***requires update of .net nuget package to ensure compatibility***

* TimeZoneId: it was possible to add a user or device with "Unknown" time zone ID.

* DiagnosticSearch: Added DiagnosticType property to search by the type of diagnostic. Ex, only GoFault diagnostics.

* Added "ExpiredPasswordException" object. This exception can be thrown if a user makes a request while their ChangePassword flag is true. The user must change their password before they are able to successfully make further requests

* SecurityRole: Added "ReportHosAvailability" 
***requires update of .net nuget package to ensure compatibility***

* If you are using the .net nuget package and plan to use the new "HOS Only" device plan you must update to nuget package version 5.7.1701 or greater to ensure compatibility.

## 5.7.1612

* Id refactoring - The ID object has been refactored in the .NET SDK. See [this forum post](https://helpdesk.geotab.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/255601466--NET-SDK-ID-Object-Changes) for details.

* Updated description of GoCurveAuxiliary (GO4v3, GO6, GO7) properties:
ImmobilizeUnit: With ImmobilizeUnit being true, it is used to define the delay before the driver identification reminder is sent out if the driver key has not been not swiped. The maximum value of this property is 255. When it is less or equal to 180, it indicates the number of seconds of the delay.  When it is greater than 180, the delay increases 30 seconds for every increment of one of this property. For example, 180 indicates 180 seconds, 181 indicates 210 seconds, and 182 indicates 240 seconds.
ImmobilizeArming: A value mainly used for enable or disable driver identification reminder. If it is used in conjunction with vehicle relay circuits, it can force the driver to swipe the driver key before starting the vehicle.
