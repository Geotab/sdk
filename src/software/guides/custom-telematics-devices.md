title: Using Custom Telematics Devices
---

Geotab provides the ability to integrate non-GO device telematics devices into the platform. These devices are defined as any telematics device that is not manufactured or sold by Geotab but is used in conjunction with Geotabâ€™s fleet management application.

# Getting Started

To get started with the registration process, please refer to the [Custom Telematics Devices and MyGeotab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mddnxc2qKBCNYvVu0-BXcyR-blPlHwa0Zun0mBzZt88){:target="_blank"} document.

## Device Management

Geotab uses MyAdmin API to manage devices and uses Data Intake Gateway to intake device data

To manage devices, the following MyAdmin API calls are most frequently used:
* [Authenticate](https://geotab.github.io/sdk/myadmin-sdk/api/reference/#Authenticate) (an example is given in [What is the Authenticate MyAdmin API method](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mddnxc2qKBCNYvVu0-BXcyR-blPlHwa0Zun0mBzZt88/edit#heading=h.bub5istj4ydv))
* [ProvisionDeviceToAccount](https://geotab.github.io/sdk/myadmin-sdk/api/reference/#ProvisionDeviceToAccount_1) (an example is given in [What are the ProvisionDevice/ProvisionDeviceToAccount MyAdmin API method](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mddnxc2qKBCNYvVu0-BXcyR-blPlHwa0Zun0mBzZt88/edit#heading=h.y7845beasdle))
* [ProvisionDevice](https://geotab.github.io/sdk/myadmin-sdk/api/reference/#ProvisionDevice_1) (an example is given in [What are the ProvisionDevice/ProvisionDeviceToAccount MyAdmin API method](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mddnxc2qKBCNYvVu0-BXcyR-blPlHwa0Zun0mBzZt88/edit#heading=h.y7845beasdle))
* [UpdateDeviceContracts](https://geotab.github.io/sdk/myadmin-sdk/api/reference/#UpdateDeviceContracts)
* [TerminateDeviceBilling](https://geotab.github.io/sdk/myadmin-sdk/api/reference/#TerminateDeviceBilling)

## Custom Telematics Device Serial Numbers
Before data can be sent for a custom telematics device, you must provision (generate) a serial number and add an asset to your MyGeotab database using this serial number.

Calling the ProvisionDevice or ProvisionDeviceToAccount MyAdmin API method returns a unique serial number.

Both calls must include a  **Product ID**, which is a unique identifier assigned to each type of custom telematics device. The Product ID determines the first 2 characters of the generated serial number. For example, using Product ID 10032 will always generate a serial number starting with "CX". You will be assigned a Product ID during development of your integration, and you can start by using 10032 for a [CustomDevice](https://geotab.github.io/sdk/software/api/reference/#CustomDevice) or 10184 for a [CustomVehicleDevice](https://geotab.github.io/sdk/software/api/reference/#CustomVehicleDevice).

## Sending Data

To intake data from a Custom Telematics Device, the usage of [Data Intake Gateway](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15uNuPqwFcPLe6vKs_JgY5nPTy2isQ3WYUu4oyQ3cEfQ){:target="_blank"} is required. The required API calls, and recommended workflows are documented in the linked document.
