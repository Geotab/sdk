Geotab provides the ability to integrate non-GO device telematics devices into the platform. These devices are defined as any telematics device that is not manufactured or sold by Geotab but is used in conjunction with Geotab’s fleet management application.

# Getting Started

Integrating a Custom Telematics Device with the Geotab platform requires the use of the [Data Intake Gateway](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15uNuPqwFcPLe6vKs_JgY5nPTy2isQ3WYUu4oyQ3cEfQ){:target="_blank"}.
