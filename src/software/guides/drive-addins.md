> Geotab Drive Add-Ins are in preview release and subject to change_

## Overview

The MyGeotab Add-In structure can be applied to the Geotab Drive application as well, providing you the ability to extend the functionality for drivers in an environment with sensors (e.g. geolocation and acceleration) and actuators (e.g. voice alerts and notifications). This environment must also be completely operable in an offline state — so your Add-In must be able to handle having no internet connection, or sleeping in the background of the mobile device.

Please read the [Developing Add-Ins](../developing-addins) guide first before attempting a Geotab Drive Add-In.

All Add-Ins that have been designed to work with MyGeotab will work on the Geotab Drive app as well. Your Add-In will be completely downloaded for all referenced links, images, and scripts upon user login. This way, as the user is authenticated over the internet — they will have your Add-In with them as they travel or disconnect from the network. If your Add-In requires dynamic loading of CSS, images, or JavaScript — these requests will fail if the user does not have a network connection. As such you should either: include all dependencies on creation of the Add-In, explicitly link to them, or provide a fallback if **state.online** returns False. Geotab Drive Add-Ins will also display differently, on both the dashboard and the menu.

To make an Add-In on the Geotab Drive app, the **item** in your configuration file must have a **path** that equals " **DriveAppLink/**" (including a trailing forward slash). The menuName, url, and version will remain unchanged. For example:

### Listing 1 — Geotab Drive "item" configuration

```json
"items": [{
 "version": "1.0",
 "url": "addinFile.html",
 "path": "DriveAppLink/",
 "menuName": {
  "en": "English Label",
  "fr": "French Label"
 }
}]
```

> The array of **items** also allows you to have one link item in MyGeotab, and another link item to Geotab Drive

## API and State Documentation

Inside the Geotab Drive app, we provide the same _api_ and _state_ properties for your initialize method that we do for our normal Add-Ins. In addition to this, we provide you with properties and methods to allow access to mobile device sensors/actuators. See Table 1 below for a list of the properties and methods provided.

### Table 1 — Geotab Drive additional properties and methods

|   | **Description** | **Parameters** | **Return Type** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| api.mobile.exists() | Returns `true` if Geotab Drive is running within a native application, and `false` if just as a HTML5 web application | None | Boolean |
| api.mobile.getVersion() | If `api.mobile.exists()`, gets the Geotab Drive version from the native application | None | String |
| api.mobile.speak() | If `api.mobile.exists()`, uses the text to speech functionality on the mobile device | String | Void |
| api.mobile.notify() | If `api.mobile.exists()`, will add a notification to the top bar of a native operating system Example: `api.mobile.notify("Fill up your vehicle", "Low on gas")` | String[Message], String[Title], String[Id], [String[JsonData]], [Boolean[Permanent]] | Void |
| api.mobile.geolocation | A navigator object that is similar to HTML5 `navigator.geolocation` Example: `api.mobile.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function (position) { }, function (error) { }, { enableHighAccuracy: true })` | None | None |
| api.mobile.navigate() | If `api.mobile.exists()`, allows navigation from addin/host application to another page using the respective hash URL of the page. Example: `api.mobile.navigate(“hos”)` | String[URL] | Void |
| api.mobile.listenTo() | If api.mobile.exists(), it currently allows you to listen to events generated by the Geotab Drive application, and use a callback function to be notified with the incoming data. It returns a function that, when called, will turn this listener off. Currently, only incoming GPS data is sent (obtained from both IOX-USB data and mobile GPS data). Example: `api.mobile.listenTo(GpsData, callback)` | String[EventName] (Valid values for EventName:`GpsData`), Function[Callback] | Function[Void] |
| state.device | Get the current vehicle that is being connected to the mobile device | None | String |
| state.driving | Mobile device is detected as driving with the current vehicle | None | Boolean |
| state.charging | Mobile device is being powered | None | Boolean |
| state.background | Geotab Drive application is running in the background | None | Boolean |
| state.online | Mobile device has internet access | None | Boolean |
| state.deviceCommunicating | Telematics device is communicating to the server | None | Boolean |
| state.gpsConnected | Mobile device has GPS enabled | None | Boolean |

## Opening third-party applications using URI schema

> Drive app v4.1.0+

It's possible to open different applications like prontoforms or native calendar from add-ins. To do so, it's important to construct correct URI schema string and pass it to `window.open. For example:

```javascript
window.open(uriSchemaString, "_system")
```

Make sure to read carefully documentation of the app you're trying to open to use correct schema. For example, to open twitter application from addin you should use:

```javascript
window.open("twitter://messages", "_system")
```

You can't use just `twitter://` as it's not correct and app won't open. You need to specify which page you want to open: `messages`, `account` etc.

To open webpage you need to use the same method, but with this notation:

```javascript
window.open("https://google.com", "_blank")
```

> `_blank` is important, especially for iOS devices
